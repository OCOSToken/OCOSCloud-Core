# 🌩️ OCOS Cloud

**OCOS Cloud** is a decentralized, modular, and Web3-native cloud infrastructure developed by the OCOS ecosystem. It offers a fully scalable, DAO-governed platform for hosting AI workloads, Web3 applications, NFT assets, and blockchain smart contracts, enabling a future where compute and storage resources are transparently owned and democratically managed.

## 🔧 Core Components

### 📦 CloudCompute
- Decentralized compute nodes supporting AI, ML, and high-performance computing.
- GPU-enabled instances for inference, training, and on-chain computation.
- Usage metered via OCOS token with auto-scaling and redundancy.

### 🗄️ DataVault
- IPFS, Filecoin, and Arweave integrated decentralized storage.
- NFT asset archiving, DAO document backups, and encrypted vault support.
- Multi-chain compatibility and off-chain redundancy.

### 🧠 OCOS AI & Web3 Services
- Pre-trained AI APIs available to dApps (e.g., text-to-image, voice synthesis).
- OCOS SDK for building and deploying smart dApps with minimal backend setup.
- Integrated REST/WebSocket APIs for live blockchain and cloud events.

### 🌐 OCOS DAPP Hosting
- Direct hosting of decentralized apps with built-in routing, SSL, and DNS.
- Smart contract endpoints and Web3 wallet integration.
- Seamless IPFS hash publishing with OCOS token-based payment.

### 🔐 Identity & Wallet Layer
- WalletConnect, MetaMask, TrustWallet, and Ledger support.
- Non-custodial identity layer tied to resource ownership.
- DAO-based node verification and user reputation tracking.
