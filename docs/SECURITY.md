# 🔐 OCOS Cloud Security Policy

This document outlines the security practices, threat mitigation strategies, and responsible disclosure process for the OCOS Cloud project.

---

## 🔒 Core Security Principles

1. **On-Chain Verifiability**
   - All transactions, usage logs, governance votes, and resource allocations are recorded on-chain.
   - Smart contracts are public and verified on BscScan or Etherscan.

2. **Modular Isolation**
   - Each contract (e.g., ComputeBilling, CloudVault) operates in a logically isolated context.
   - Access control and ownership are handled per-contract.

3. **Minimal Trusted Roles**
   - Admin privileges are strictly limited and optionally assignable to DAO or multisig wallets.
   - Time-locks may be implemented for critical function calls.

4. **Event Monitoring**
   - All sensitive operations emit logs: staking, vault withdrawals, DAO votes, etc.
   - Event indexing and off-chain monitoring are strongly recommended for node operators.

## 🛠 Hardening Measures

| Layer            | Protection Mechanism                        |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Smart Contracts  | Audit-ready code, modular design            |
| Token Handling   | Non-custodial, ERC-20 transfer logic only   |
| Governance       | DAO-based upgrades + proposal logs          |
| File Vault       | CID + ownership hashing, delete restricted  |
| Node Registry    | Signature-based registration optional       |
| Billing          | Usage-bound payment system                  |
| Proof Registry   | One-time ZK proof submission                |

## 🧪 Auditing & Formal Verification

- All core smart contracts will undergo audit via **CertiK**, **Code4rena**, or **Sherlock**.
- Static analysis and test coverage tools (e.g., MythX, Slither, Foundry) are used in CI/CD.
- Code is versioned, tagged, and checksum-verified for each release.

## 👨‍💻 Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate community involvement in maintaining the platform's security. Please follow these steps for reporting vulnerabilities:

1. Email us at **security@ocos.io** with subject `Security Report`
2. Include:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Affected components or contracts
3. We will respond within **72 hours**
4. Verified disclosures may be rewarded based on impact level

> Do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly until a patch has been deployed and verified.
