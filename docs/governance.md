# 🗳️ OCOS Cloud Governance Overview

This document outlines the decentralized governance model of the OCOS Cloud ecosystem, led by the `CloudDAO.sol` contract and empowered by OCOS token holders.

## 🧱 Governance Architecture

| Layer              | Role Description                                               |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CloudDAO.sol`     | Smart contract for proposals, votes, and execution logic       |
| OCOS Token         | Used for voting power (1 token = 1 vote)                       |
| Proposal System    | Lifecycle management of upgrades, changes, and DAO rules       |
| Multisig Admin     | Interim admin rights for bootstrap and emergency changes       |

---

## 📜 Proposal Lifecycle

### 1. **Proposal Creation**
- Only by Admin or whitelisted proposers (initially)
- Includes `title`, `description`, and optional action scripts

### 2. **Voting Period**
- Duration: 3–7 days (configurable)
- Minimum Quorum: 2%–5% of total supply (dynamic)
- Voting Power: Snapshot of OCOS token balances

### 3. **Result Finalization**
- Proposal passes if:
  - Voting period ends
  - Quorum is met
  - Majority votes (50%+) in favor
- Otherwise marked as expired or rejected

### 4. **Execution**
- If proposal includes a transaction (e.g., ownership transfer, contract call), it can be executed via on-chain DAO logic

## 🛠 Vote Types

| Type              | Purpose                                |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `Text`            | Advisory opinion / signal-only vote     |
| `Upgrade`         | Smart contract or config upgrade        |
| `Funding`         | Allocate treasury funds                 |
| `Role`            | Assign or revoke admin/operator roles   |

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Quorum and delay mechanics reduce takeover risk
- Voting weight is based on snapshot, preventing flash-loan voting
- DAO-controlled contracts use time-locks for high-impact functions

## 📬 Governance Resources

- CloudDAO Smart Contract: [`CloudDAO.sol`](../contracts/CloudDAO.sol)
- Proposal Creation Script: [`createProposal()`](../scripts/createProposal.js)
- Voting UI: [Coming Soon]

---

## 🌍 Community Participation

- Token holders are encouraged to:
  - Propose improvements
  - Delegate votes
  - Participate in audits and ecosystem decisions

---

> The OCOS DAO is designed to evolve. All changes to DAO rules must themselves be governed by DAO proposal and vote.
