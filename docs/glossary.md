# 📘 OCOS Cloud Glossary

A reference of technical and governance-related terms used throughout the OCOS Cloud ecosystem.

---

### 🔗 **Admin**
An authorized account (EOA or multisig) with elevated permissions to deploy, configure, or manage core contracts before DAO control.

---

### 🧱 **CloudVault**
A decentralized storage contract that records file metadata (e.g., IPFS CIDs), access ownership, and OCOS-token-backed storage quota usage.

---

### 💻 **ComputeNode**
A registered OCOS Cloud node that provides GPU/CPU computational resources in exchange for OCOS token rewards or user staking.

---

### 🧠 **ComputeStaking**
The smart contract module where users stake OCOS tokens to gain access to compute time on the platform.

---

### 🔐 **CloudDAO**
The Decentralized Autonomous Organization that governs platform upgrades, fund allocations, and critical decision-making processes.

---

### 📄 **Contract Ownership**
The address that controls administrative functions of a smart contract. Can be transferred or replaced by DAO vote.

---

### 🧾 **DAO Proposal**
A formal on-chain request to change a contract, release tokens, or assign a role. Requires quorum and expiration to pass.

---

### 📦 **Deployment Script**
A Hardhat or Foundry-based JavaScript/TypeScript script used to compile, deploy, and configure smart contracts in the OCOS ecosystem.

---

### 🧰 **Hardhat**
The development framework used for compiling, testing, and deploying all Solidity contracts within OCOS Cloud.

---

### 📈 **NodeRewardVault**
Smart contract holding and distributing OCOS token rewards to eligible compute/storage node operators.

---

### 📚 **OCOS Token**
The core BEP-20/ERC-20 utility and governance token powering payments, staking, and DAO votes across all OCOS Cloud modules.

---

### 🧪 **Proof-of-Usage**
The log created when a compute session is executed, storing metadata like timestamps and cost in `ComputeBilling.sol`.

---

### 🔎 **zkComputeProof**
Smart contract used to submit and verify zero-knowledge proofs that validate private compute task execution.

---

### 🌐 **Web3 API Gateway**
The off-chain endpoint layer that allows users and applications to interact with smart contracts via REST or SDK wrappers.
