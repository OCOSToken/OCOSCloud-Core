# 🧠 OCOS Cloud Architecture

The OCOS Cloud infrastructure is designed to serve as a decentralized, resilient, and modular Web3-native cloud platform. Built on blockchain principles and governed by a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), OCOS Cloud enables the secure hosting of compute services, storage layers, dApps, AI workloads, and more—all controlled transparently through smart contracts and token-based logic.

---

## 📐 Architectural Overview

OCOS Cloud is built on a **four-layer architecture** to ensure modularity, scalability, and verifiability:

### 1. **Core Layer (Governance & Ledger)**
Responsible for:
- DAO-based governance
- Smart contract execution
- Tokenomics & payments
- Node registration and permissioning

**Key Technologies:**
- Solidity smart contracts
- BEP20 OCOS token standard
- Chainlink Oracles
- DAO Voting System (via OCOS DAO)

---

### 2. **Compute Layer (CloudCompute Engine)**
This layer provides GPU-based virtualized compute power for decentralized AI workloads, simulations, and custom user apps.

**Features:**
- GPU/CPU node reservation via staking OCOS tokens
- Real-time job execution
- Node health monitoring and reputation scoring
- Modular container orchestration (Docker + decentralized schedulers)

**Node Types:**
- AI Nodes (for ML/LLM workloads)
- WASM Compute Nodes (for dApps)
- Simulation Nodes (for games/simulation engines)

---

### 3. **Storage Layer (DataVault Network)**
Provides secure, distributed, and immutable storage for:
- NFT files and metadata
- DAO governance records
- Off-chain user files
- Smart contract states

**Integrations:**
- IPFS (for fast DApp hosting)
- Arweave (for permanent storage)
- Filecoin (for off-chain backups)

**Access Controls:**
- Wallet-authenticated encryption
- DAO-based file retrieval rules
- Burnable access keys (for sensitive data)

---

### 4. **Interaction Layer (Web3 Services & UI)**
Provides tools and protocols for developers and users to interact with OCOS Cloud services.

**Tools:**
- OCOS SDK (Web3 API access, compute, deploy, audit)
- dApp hosting (with auto DNS/IPFS)
- REST + GraphQL APIs
- OCOS AI Gateway (AI tools via cloud nodes)

**UI Layer:**
- React-based cloud dashboard
- WalletConnect & MetaMask integrations
- Compute & storage analytics

## 🔐 Security & Trust Framework

| Component            | Security Layer                          |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Smart Contracts      | Audited by CertiK, multichain hardened  |
| Compute Nodes        | Signed job IDs, resource capping        |
| Storage Layer        | Encrypted with wallet-based access      |
| Governance           | DAO-voted upgrades only                 |
| Token Payments       | Non-custodial BEP20 verified transfers  |

**Extra Measures:**
- Node reputation system
- Verifiable compute proofs
- IPFS CID audit trail

## 📦 Token-Based Resource Management

OCOS token acts as the fuel of the platform:

| Use Case              | Mechanism                            |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Compute Access        | Stake OCOS to unlock node time         |
| Storage Quota         | Monthly or per-GB OCOS payments        |
| Governance Voting     | 1 OCOS = 1 Vote                        |
| Contributor Rewards   | Nodes rewarded per job/min uptime     |

## 🔄 Decentralization Principles

- 🌍 Nodes are globally distributed and independently operated
- 🗳️ Platform upgrades, feature rollouts, and resource rates are governed by DAO votes
- 🔍 All interactions are auditable on-chain
- 🤝 Open-source interfaces for transparency and reproducibility

---

## 🔧 Developer Deployment Workflow

1. **Connect Wallet**: Authenticate via MetaMask or WalletConnect
2. **Upload App/Model**: Via dashboard or SDK CLI
3. **Select Nodes**: Choose required compute/storage configuration
4. **Token Payment**: Pay with OCOS or stake for quotas
5. **Monitor Logs**: Track usage, analytics, and rewards

---

## 🛠 Planned Enhancements

- zkCompute proofs (zero-knowledge resource validations)
- Cross-chain support (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum)
- Edge deployment protocol (for mobile/WebGPU nodes)
- Fully decentralized scheduler (based on IPFS pub/sub)
