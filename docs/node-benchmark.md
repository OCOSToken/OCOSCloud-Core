# 🧪 OCOS Cloud Node Benchmarking Guidelines

This document defines the standards and procedures for measuring and reporting the performance of compute and storage nodes participating in the OCOS Cloud network.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To ensure reliability and performance across the decentralized infrastructure, all participating nodes (GPU/CPU/Storage) must report verified benchmarks to:
- Qualify for staking eligibility
- Rank for task allocation priority
- Receive proportional reward rates

## 📊 Benchmark Metrics

| Metric                | Description                                  | Unit        |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------|
| CPU Performance       | Integer and floating-point task speed       | GFLOPS      |
| GPU Performance       | Matrix operations / inference latency       | TFLOPS/ms   |
| RAM                   | Available system memory                     | GB          |
| Disk I/O              | Write/read throughput                      | MB/s        |
| Uptime                | Node availability ratio (past 30d)          | %           |
| Bandwidth             | Upload/download throughput                  | Mbps        |

## 🛠 Benchmark Submission

Node operators must submit benchmarks via CLI or Web3 call:
```bash
npx ocos-cloud-cli submit-benchmark --nodeId 42 --cpu 128 --gpu 9.6 --ram 32 --io 450 --bandwidth 100 --uptime 99.5
```

Each submission includes:
- Signed message using node wallet
- Timestamp + node ID
- Encrypted proof-of-benchmark (PoB) hash (optional)

---

## 🏆 Reward Calibration

Rewards from `NodeRewardVault.sol` are adjusted based on:
- Relative benchmark score vs network average
- Historical job completion rate
- Uptime score

Nodes with verified PoBs receive boosted multiplier weights.

---

## 🔐 Verification

- DAO or auditor nodes may request re-benchmark at any time
- Randomized challenge tests for uptime & task latency
- zkBenchmark (planned) module will verify off-chain metrics

---

## 🧠 Reporting & Analytics

All benchmark data is aggregated into the OCOS Cloud analytics dashboard:
- Node performance trends
- Job allocation heatmaps
- Historical reward correlation graphs

- Telegram: [@ocos_official](https://t.me/ocos_official)
- DAO Audits: `CloudDAO.sol` proposals may trigger network-wide recalibration

> Performance equals reputation in OCOS Cloud. Benchmarked nodes earn trust, tasks, and rewards.
