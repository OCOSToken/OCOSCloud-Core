# 🔍 OCOS Cloud Smart Contract Audit Process

This document describes the security audit lifecycle for all core smart contracts deployed in the OCOS Cloud ecosystem. Our process ensures resilience, transparency, and continuous review.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in smart contracts before and after deployment by leveraging independent auditors, community reviews, and automated tools.

## 🧱 Scope of Audits

| Contract               | Purpose                                   |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `OcosCloudHost.sol`    | Core service manager (compute/storage)    |
| `ComputeStaking.sol`   | Token staking and quota assignment        |
| `NodeRewardVault.sol`  | Reward payout for node operators          |
| `CloudVault.sol`       | Encrypted file metadata storage           |
| `ComputeBilling.sol`   | Usage metering and cost tracking          |

## 🧪 Audit Phases

### Phase 1: Internal Review
- Manual code walkthrough by OCOS core team
- Unit test and edge-case simulation
- Static analysis with tools: Slither, MythX

### Phase 2: Third-Party Audit
- External audit by firms (e.g., **CertiK**, **Code4rena**, **Sherlock**)
- Audit scope report and timeline shared via GitHub

### Phase 3: Community Review
- Public release of audit report
- GitHub issues enabled for security findings
- DAO-initiated patch proposals if needed

### Phase 4: Post-Deployment Monitoring
- Integration with Tenderly for runtime alerts
- Watchdog scripts on block activity anomalies
- Optional bug bounty triggers for critical areas

- ✅ Integer overflow/underflow
- ✅ Access control bypass
- ✅ Token mismanagement
- ✅ Governance hijack vectors
- ✅ Storage layout bugs
- ✅ DoS and front-running risks

---

## 📄 Audit Artifacts

- Audit PDFs (uploaded to `/audits/`)
- `audit.json` for hash checksums and versions
- GitHub issues and pull requests with audit tags
